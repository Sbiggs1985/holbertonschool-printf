@brief The _printf function prints formatted output to the stdout stream

string may contain conversion specifications, each of which results in fetching

@param format The format string containing conversion specifications
@param ... Optional arguments to be printed according to the format string
@return The number of characters printed, excluding the null byte used to end
output to strings. If an output error occurs, the function returns a negative value.
